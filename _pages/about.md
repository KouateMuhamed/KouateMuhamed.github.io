<br/>
I am a Student Researcher at Google@[PAIR](https://research.google/teams/brain/pair/), and a Bachelor's student in Computer Science (minor in Internet of Things, Big Data & Machine Learning) at Università degli studi di Udine (Italy). <br/>
From April '22 I'm working as **Research Assistant** at [Biomedical Image Computing](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/) - ETH under the supervision of [Gustav Bredell](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/people/person-details.gustav-bredell.html), and  Professor [Ender Konukoglu](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~kender/) on 3D Segmentation Reconstruction for Lumbar Spine. <br/>
For more information, please see my [resume](http://kouatemuhamed.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

Previously, I worked with Professor [Ehsan Adeli](https://stanford.edu/~eadeli/) as a **Visiting Student Researcher** at the [Computational Neuroscience Lab](http://cnslab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University on generation of images starting from the text with DALL‑E. <br/>
Furthermore, I was part-time AI Engineer in Computer Vision at Bidpremium working on Anomaly Detection.

My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. <br/>
Currently, I am focusing on Video Summarization, Action Anticipation, and Medical Image Classification.<br/>
