**Email**: kouate[dot]muhamed[at]spes[dot]uniud[dot]it <br/>
<br/>
I am a Bachelor's student in Computer Science (minor in Internet of Things, Big Data & Machine Learning) at Università degli studi di Udine (Italy). <br/>
I am working with [Dr Ehsan Adeli](https://stanford.edu/~eadeli/) in the [Computational Neuroscience Lab](http://cnslab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, and Dr [Niki Martinel](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~niki.martinel/)([MLP](https://machinelearning.uniud.it/)). <br/>
Furthermore, I am a part-time AI Engineer in Computer Vision at Bidpremium (Italy).

My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. <br/>
Currently, I am focusing on Video Summarization, Action Anticipation, and Medical Image Classification.<br/>
For more information, please see my [CV](http://kouatemuhamed.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

When I'm not in front of books or a laptop, you can find me out and about on a mountain bike (https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26f0.png?v8) or in the mountains :mountain:
